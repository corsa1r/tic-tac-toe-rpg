# RPG Tic-Tac-Toe
### Because the classical game is just boring

Play with your opponent online.
Chose a hero class to play with. Each class provides one spectacular ability that lets you advance in the game. Or sabotage your enemy.
*It is completely unfair and has no balance [just like in life]*

Possible heroes are:

| Name      | Ability Name      | What it does                                                                 |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gandalf   | You Shalln't Pass | Place the flame of Anor in a box preventing your enemy from placing a mark in it|
| Frodo     | You See Me Not    | Put The One Ring on your finger and place a mark, but don't let your opponent see where. If they chose a box that has been used by you - they lose their turn|
| Illidan   | You Are Not Ready | Get mad that the chicken is not cocked and burst into flames burning random marks.                |
| Chochi    | Cuteness Overload     | Compel your opponent to do your bidding. Lure them into a box with your cuteness and force them to place a mark there.   |
| Peon | Job's Done          | Play as yourself - Useless with no abilities, just like IRL   |
| Stormwind Peasant | King's Honor, Friend          | Play as yourself - Useless with no abilities, just like IRL   |
